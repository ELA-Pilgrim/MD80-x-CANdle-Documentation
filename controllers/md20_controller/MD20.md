# MD20

MD20 is a mall brushless motor controller. It is best suited to small and precise gimbaling motors. The controller features position PID, velocity PID, impedance, raw torque, profile position and profile velocity operation modes. MD20 can be easily daisy-chained, for easy connection of many drives in a single control network.

```{hint}
You can easily check your MD80 version using the [`mdtool setup info`](mdtool_setup_info) command.
