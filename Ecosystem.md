## Safety information

Even though the MD series motor controller is a small brushless controller it can push a substantial
amount of current through the motor windings. This means there are many hazards related to the high
torques that the actuator is able to produce as well as elevated temperatures that may occur close
to the MD series motor controller controller or the motor. Always make sure the actuator is mounted
firmly and does not pose a threat to its surroundings. Make sure the power supply current limits are
set to low values (~1A) as an additional safety measure when you are unsure about the tested
behavior of the system.
