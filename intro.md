**CANdle Ecosystem** is a system of brushless actuator controllers (MD series motor controller) and
translator devices (CANdle) used for interfacing with them. MD series controller actuators can be used
in advanced robotic projects like quadrupedal robots, robotic manipulators, exoskeletons, gimbals, and
many more.

## MD series motor controller

MD series motor controller is a highly integrated brushless motor controller. It can be interfaced with
a great variety of motors to turn them into advanced servo actuators. MD series motor controller can
work with both direct drive (no gearbox) and geared motors.

## CANdle and CANdle HAT

CANdle (CAN + dongle) is a translator device between the host controller and the MD series motor
controller drivers. It is possible to interface CANdle with a regular PC over USB bus or CANdle HAT with
SBCs (such as Raspberry PI) over USB, SPI or UART bus. The latest CANdle and CANdle HAT devices are
fitted with a switch for enabling and disabling the built-in termination resistor.

We officially support Linux x86-64 and ARMv8-A architecture hosts.

## Hardware setup

CAN bus topology is a single-line network structure. A typical hardware connection/wiring scheme for
CANdle x MD ecosystem is presented in the picture below:

```{hint} In case youâ€™d like to read more about the recommended lengths of the bus segments we suggest the [elektormotus guide](https://emusbms.com/files/bms/docs/Elektromotus_CAN_bus_recommendations_v0.2_rc3.pdf).
```

The CAN bus termination is a single Molex connector with an embedded 120Ohm resistor. Termination should
be always be attached to the last controller in a string.
